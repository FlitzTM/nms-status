| Description:      |   | Please notice the maintenance announcement of our upstream-provider noris network AG: To ensure the stable operation of our network infrastructure we need to perform software updates on central networking devices at the sites NBG3 (Deutschherrnstr. 15-19, Nuremberg) during the above mentioned timeframe. Due to the redundant design of the affected systems an outage of network connections is not expected. Please note that you may experience short disruptions of network connections during the failover to the redundant device. |
